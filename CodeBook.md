Source
----------------

The `tidyData2.txt` was created based on the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0** created by:

This data set was created from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.   

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.  

For each record it was provided:  

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

We used the following files from the data set:

* **features.txt:** List of all features.

* **activity_labels.txt:** Links the class labels with their activity name.

* **train/X_train.txt:** Training set.

* **train/y_train.txt:** Training labels.

* **test/X_test.txt:** Test set.

* **test/y_test.txt:** Test labels.

* **train/subject_train.txt** and **test/subject_test.txt**: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

Transformations
------------------------

The `tidyData2.txt` file was created by:  
* Merging the test and train data sets; 
* Extracting only the measurements where the `mean()` or the `std()` function were applied;  
* Adding a column with the activity name; and  
* Taking the mean of all measurements summarized by the activity name and the subject who performed the activity.

The details of the transformations applied can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/HuascarDuarte/GettingCleaningDataProject.git/) file.

Contents
------------------------

The `tidyData2.txt` is a blank separated text file with header that contains for each of 6 activities of each of 30 subjects (totalizing 180 lines) the mean of the following data:  
* Mean and Std of tBodyAcc-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of tGravityAcc-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of tBodyGyro-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of tBodyAccMag  
* Mean and Std of tGravityAccMag  
* Mean and Std of tBodyAccJerkMag  
* Mean and Std of tBodyGyroMag  
* Mean and Std of tBodyGyroJerkMag  
* Mean and Std of fBodyAcc-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of fBodyGyro-XYZ  
* Mean and Std of fBodyAccMag  
* Mean and Std of fBodyAccJerkMag  
* Mean and Std of fBodyGyroMag  
* Mean and Std of fBodyGyroJerkMag  
* gravityMean-XYZ  
* tBodyAccMean  
* tBodyAccJerkMean  
* tBodyGyroMean  
* tBodyGyroJerkMean  

This information comes from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.   

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).   

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).  

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
